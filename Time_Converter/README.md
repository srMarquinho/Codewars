I have created this Kata when learnig Ruby DATE and TIME class and now I want to share with you!




###Description:

  Given a time in a time format class, return it without year, month and day.

  It should return a string including milliseconds with 3 decimals.

####Example:
```ruby

#Should return: 
"16:42:59,000"
```
